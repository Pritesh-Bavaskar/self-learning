                  Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the
                  countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.
                  Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of
                  the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named
                  Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary
                  regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted
                  parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

                  Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind
                  texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a
                  small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to
                  leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her
                  not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild
                  Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
                  didn't listen.

                  She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt
                  and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills
                  of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the
                  skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of
                  Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line
                  Lane.
